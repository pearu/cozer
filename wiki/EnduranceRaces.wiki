#summary How to organize endurance races with Cozer

= How to specify race course =

In `General Information/Race pattern` table column, specify the course using the following pattern:
{{{
<Lap length>/<Race time>
}}}
where lap length should be given in meters and race time in hours.
For example,
{{{
5000/6
}}}
specifies 6h endurance race on 5000m circuit.


= How to generate intermediate results =

U.I.M. rules require that intermediate results are posted during a race.

In cozer, everytime you wish to generate results report, in `Edit Race Record` page you must re-select all class/heat combinations currently running. Then go to `Reports` page and select `Endurance Full Final` as a report type.
