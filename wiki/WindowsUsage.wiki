#summary Installing COZER and friends under Windows
#labels Featured

= Introduction =

COZER is a Python program that requires in addition to Python itself the following programs: MikTeX for generating reports and wxPython for graphical user interface.
Adobe Reader is optional but highly recommended for printing reports in PDF format (by default, MikTeX provides Yap that can be used for printing reports in DVI format).
Finally, to grap/update COZER program from its SVN repository, TortoiseSVN is recommended.

= Installation =

Below follows detailed instructions how I recently (July 2012) set up COZER
under Windows 7:

  * Download Python 2.7: http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/python-2.7.3.msi; run to install.
  * Download wxPython: http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wxpython/wxPython2.8-win32-ansi-2.8.12.1-py27.exe; run to install.
  * Download MikTeX: go to http://miktex.org/2.9/setup and download  "Basic MiKTeX 2.9" Installer; run to install.
  * Download Subversion client: go to http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html and download TortoiseSVN; run to install.
  * Checkout the latest COZER from SVN repository: https://code.google.com/p/cozer/source/checkout

= Usage =

Assuming that installation went smoothly and the COZER source code path http://cozer.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ is checked out to a directory {{{cozer}}}, just go to this directory and double-click on {{{cozer.py}}} script.
That should open COZER graphical user interface.
